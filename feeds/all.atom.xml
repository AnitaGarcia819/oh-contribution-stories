(Here's &lt;a href="http://openhatch.org/blog/2013/how-i-found-an-open-source-project-for-me/"&gt;that story in more detail.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started hanging out on OpenHatch's IRC channel and mailing lists, generally learning about the project, getting to know its people, and finding out where I could help with its goals (helping people contribute to free and open source projects). I'm a community manager instead of a developer, so often the things I can help with aren't listed in a bug tracker. One of these ways of helping happened a few months later. I realized that OpenHatch-the-organization did a lot more than what the OpenHatch website homepage described -- and that the homepage was unintentionally outdated, instead of being purposefully designed to focus on only a few things. So at an in-person project sprint soon after that, I decided that my task for the day would be to work on this problem! To propose some changes, I wrote emails to the development mailing list: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://lists.openhatch.org/pipermail/devel/2014-January/003370.html"&gt;"Let's link important things from the homepage"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://lists.openhatch.org/pipermail/devel/2014-January/003371.html"&gt;"Let's also put more social media on the homepage"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then at the sprint, I talked about these ideas with a long-time contributor to get confirmation that these were good ideas, and I started making a simple mockup of how the additional information could fit into the page. It was nice to do this kind of design work at an in-person sprint because I knew I could get immediate focused feedback from other contributors, instead of risking veering off into paths that other contributors wouldn't support. It's also much easier to talk about design when you can point at a screen together.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on my mockup more in the next couple weeks, and then at one of our regular IRC "office hours" meetings, I discussed the revised mockup with other contributors, and we refined the design together. We &lt;a href="http://lists.openhatch.org/pipermail/devel/2014-January/003421.html"&gt;wrote to the mailing list about this mockup&lt;/a&gt; in case any other contributors were interested in providing feedback.    Nobody objected, so I &lt;a href="http://lists.openhatch.org/pipermail/devel/2014-January/003422.html"&gt;filed a formal task in our bug tracker&lt;/a&gt; with a technical description of the changes to be made. Yay! I assigned the task to a fellow contributor who had expressed interest in implementing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, she filed a &lt;a href="https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/pull/197"&gt;pull request with her changes&lt;/a&gt;, including a screenshot of her results. I gave her some feedback about the changes to explain how to make them more closely aligned with the mockup, and she updated the pull request until we both agreed that it looked good.    Another contributor merged the pull request, and a little later the change went live! &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140131204711/http://openhatch.org"&gt;Before&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140201204708/http://openhatch.org/"&gt;after&lt;/a&gt;.  This was fun. Sticking around with one project for a while meant that I had enough understanding of the project to identify a significant issue and lead our effort to fix that issue.  &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="helped by - mailing list"></category><category term="helped by - IRC"></category><category term="project - OpenHatch"></category><category term="featured"></category></entry><entry><title>Open source is hard! (or, how the test bot made me cry)</title><link href="http://mergestories.com/how-the-test-bot-made-me-cry.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-06-13T21:33:06-04:00</updated><author><name>Julia Evans</name></author><id>tag:mergestories.com,2014-06-13:how-the-test-bot-made-me-cry.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I graduated from university, I worked for a web consulting shop called &lt;a href="http://evolvingweb.ca"&gt;Evolving Web&lt;/a&gt; that used &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They cared a lot about contributing to open source, and were delightful enough to send me to DrupalCon Denver in 2012. DrupalCon was really fun! As with many open source conferences, there were sprints at the end, and I decided that I wanted to contribute to Drupal during the sprints. My employer was into it. Awesome plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the sprints, I met someone who was working on a new configuration management system for Drupal. If you're not familiar with Drupal, configuration management at that point was a HUGE PAIN. All the configuration was in the database (!!), so it was impossible to version. This sucked, a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was asking people to help convert Drupal systems to the new configuration management system. I thought this sounded SUPER AWESOME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I'm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at an awesome open source conference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with a community which is super welcoming to beginners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working on a component that I'm personally interested in improving (configuration management)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and there are people who can help me contribute in real life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT COULD BE BETTER?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I go to the sprints! The people are super friendly. I decide to work on converting search settings. Here's the issue! https://drupal.org/node/1496510&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend what feels like all day working on a patch, making a bunch of replacements like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$count = variable_get('search_embedded_form_submitted', 0);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$count = config('search.settings')-&amp;gt;get('embedded_form_submitted');&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which convert from the old settings API to the new one. (spoiler: that particular change actually made it into the final commit!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems promising! But then EVERYTHING GOES WRONG. The main thing that is wrong is that the unit test runner takes about 20 minutes to run tests, and some people say that I shouldn’t totally rely on its results. So I can't tell if the problem is with my code or the testbot, and I mostly spend the whole day being frustrated with the testbot. (you can see my attempts! I'm jvns in the issue tracker) The issue also turned to be a bit more complicated than I originally thought -- there were some subtleties with the search settings that made this not totally trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I don’t manage to get the tests to pass. I go home and cry because I was expecting it to be fun and to maybe get my patch merged and instead it was so frustrating and my patch totally didn't work. =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 months, 50 comments, and many more commits later, some later version of the patch finally gets merged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't in any way an indictment of the Drupal community -- they're so helpful and wonderful, and really committed to helping new contributors get started. But getting started contributing to open source can be really hard and frustrating, sometimes just for technical reasons like a test bot is overwhelmed at a sprint.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="project - drupal"></category><category term="helped by - community members"></category><category term="setting - sprint"></category><category term="difficulties encountered - testing"></category><category term="featured"></category></entry><entry><title>Clipping functions in SciPy</title><link href="http://mergestories.com/clipping-in-scipy.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-06-10T18:05:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Shauna Gordon-McKeon</name></author><id>tag:mergestories.com,2014-06-10:clipping-in-scipy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="http://www.scipy.org/"&gt;SciPy&lt;/a&gt; when searching for projects that were both in the domain of scientific research and statistical analysis, and written in the python programming language.  (SciPy refers to both the scientific computing library I contributed to, as well as the general open source package which also includes projects like iPython and Matplotlib.)  I felt a bit intimidated at first, because I'm not an expert in statistics or python, so I decided to start with one of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues?labels=easy-fix&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;state=open"&gt;issues labeled easy_fix&lt;/a&gt;.  I browsed through many of the issues before finding one that I thought I had a prayer of being able to handle.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/2566"&gt;The issue I picked&lt;/a&gt; dealt with the following problem.  Probabilities must be between 0 and 1.  The limit of zero means "no chance of happening" while the limit of 1 means "will always happen".  A probability of greater than 1 therefore makes no sense.  However, due to unavoidable &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-off_error"&gt;rounding errors&lt;/a&gt;, occasionally probabilities were being produced that were greater than 1.  The person who reported the issue, a maintainer, suggested that the numpy function clip be used to deal with this problem.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first step was to figure out where to make this change.  The person who reported the issue had asked to change the probabilities titled "cdf, sf, pmf".  I did a search for each of these using Github's search-repository interface.  There were many results, but only one file where the functions were defined (&lt;a href="https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/16fc0af7191dce0cfd5fa80afb3a85b50d58cbcf/scipy/stats/_distn_infrastructure.py"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;), so that seemed like a good place to start.  Rather than go too far down the wrong path, I left a quick comment asking for confirmation and got a helpful reply.  With the help of the numpy documentation for the suggested function, clip, I was able to implement this change fairly easily, but I wasn't done yet!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maintainer asked me to time the function before and after my changes.  They didn't want to accept the change if it slowed things down too much.  I'd never timed anything before, and at their suggestion explored the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html"&gt;Timeit python library&lt;/a&gt;.  I found this to be an interesting and useful tool to learn about.  Harder was choosing some "normal" and "slow" test functions -- I am not familiar enough with statistics to have an intuition of which distributions are easy to calculate and which are hard to calculate.  I searched through the documentation and issues for references to "slow" distributions until I was able to find one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I commented with the results from Timeit, only to discover that more challenges lay ahead!  First, the maintainer asked me to implement a unit test.  This is a very reasonable request, but I don't have a formal programming background and I'd never worked with unit tests before.  I was able to muddle through with the help of the maintainer, but I wish I'd had resources like &lt;a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/text/test0.html"&gt;Ned Bachtelder's talk on unit testing at PyCon 2014&lt;/a&gt; to consult!  The maintainer also advised me to develop on a separate branch from master and to use the SciPy standard acronyms when making commit messages.  Luckily I was already familiar with branching in git and amending commits and pull requests, and was able to make these changes fairly easily.  (To refresh, though, I used this great &lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-branches"&gt;branching tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when I added my tests, things did not work perfectly - my changes induced no less than 8 failures.  It turned out that one of the distributions affected by the change was incompatible with it, and I had to remove the clipping function from more than half of the places I'd added it.  Another issue was with how I'd written the test, which was by building it into a pre-existing test. This didn't make much sense - with unit tests, I now know it's good practice to test each behavior separately - and  at the maintainer's suggestion, I split it off into a new test.  At this point, we were finally finished.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; from making this contribution, thanks in large part due to the extensive help from Evgeni Burovski, the maintainer I was working with.  I highly recommend contributing to SciPy, and hope to do so again soon!&lt;/p&gt;

Individuals agree to write a blog post every week or pay $5; when enough money is collected, the group meets for pizza and beer.  The Iron Blogger software, which is built off of the &lt;a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/"&gt;Planet feed aggregator&lt;/a&gt;, provides a feed of all the blog posts written by participants combined.  I enjoyed reading this feed but was annoyed that it only showed the most recent 15 posts.  I decided to change Iron Blogger to show more.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was new to FOSS at the time and didn't really know where to begin.  Luckily I was friends with the maintainer of the project and he was able to point me to where the source code was stored (it has since moved).  After several hours of poking around the repository, looking through Planet's documentation, and emailing both my friend and the Planet mailing list, I was able to identify the variable to change.  I'm afraid I don't remember the details of the obstacles I faced, as this was several years ago now.  I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; remember telling my friend, "Okay, I found the variable!  You just need to go to line 37 in the configuration file and change itemsperpage from 15 to, say, 50..."  He told me to submit a patch.  He explained what a patch was and gave me a link to a tutorial that looked something like &lt;a href="http://jungels.net/articles/diff-patch-ten-minutes.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  I was then able to generate a patch, which he merged into the project.  A few years later, the project was put on Github, so you can see the commit (linked below).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a great first contribution to make, because it was something I cared about but also something very straightforward to fix with my programming background (which is not very extensive, but did cover variables and configuration files).  I was also lucky to have someone willing to walk me through the basics of downloading repositories and creating patches.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, some GIMP contributors contacted me about arranging an online event to help them improve their documentation.  I wanted to see how their documentation currently looked, so I went to &lt;a href="http://www.gimp.org/"&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt; and started clicking and reading links.  When I got to the link for their &lt;a href="https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/INSTALL"&gt;installation guide&lt;/a&gt;, it sent me to a blank page.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to confirm that it wasn't just a problem with my browser, so I opened up the page in both Firefox and Chrome.  Then I asked some friends (the kinds folks on the #openhatch IRC channel) what they saw at the link, and they also saw nothing.  Before I could proceed with the next step, one of them dug up the &lt;a href="https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/INSTALL.in"&gt;correct link&lt;/a&gt; for me!  I decided to file a bug so that someone else could make this presumably easy fix.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To file the bug, I found the project's bug tracker, and within that, the tracker for the GIMP website.  I checked the list of bugs to see if anyone had already reported this problem.  They hadn't, so I wrote up a quick report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took it upon myself to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email the original authors of the code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to prospective users on IRC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work on it a lot at the yearly Debian conference in 2011 -- I already planned on going, and instead of just socializing, I used the Debconf hack lab space to work on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition it to a different community that now maintains it -- I did this by intentionally making contribution really easy, and then repeatedly asking for help on the debian-mentors email list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I had a fun time. It is always a pleasure to help Debian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot about the Pylons web framework as a result, which I mostly learned through massive Googling.  &lt;/p&gt;
