In the spirit of open source, I volunteered to help with the room set up and AV preparation on the first morning of the event. I arrived early and received my tools -- a tape measure, a room map, and several rolls of blue painters’ tape. I found another AdaCamper who was willing to help me crawl around on the floor and create a blue painters’ tape path throughout the meeting rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? On that day, my contribution was creating an accessible path for others to use and a reminder to all to be respectful of open spaces. Pretty cool to make a contribution that didn’t involve lines of code, git, or code reviews. Even cooler to me, the contribution is something that I have been able to share with other groups in my local community. Sharing open knowledge and skills is one of the cornerstones of open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever wonder if your little contribution to a project or event matters, I believe it does. The beauty of many little contributions, or even one, is that it makes things a little better for others even if only for a moment. The little roll of blue tape might have another use -- it comes in handy for sticking together many small contributions of goodness. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="project - adacamp"></category><category term="helped by - community members"></category><category term="setting - conference"></category><category term="kind of contribution - misc"></category></entry></feed>
