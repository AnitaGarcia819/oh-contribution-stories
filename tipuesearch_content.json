{"pages":[{"text":"What are merge stories? Merge stories are stories about contributions that people have made to free and open source projects . They give details about the process: how people pick issues to work on, the common obstacles they run into, the resources they use to solve problems, and more. We hope that by sharing these stories, we can give newcomers a better sense of what contributing is like. There are some other benefits to submitting a story. Writing out what you did to make a contribution can help you remember what you learned later. Spelling out the details of your process can help people making similar contributions when they get stuck. And by submitting stories, you can create a record of the work you've done beyond a list of commits. Who can contribute? Anyone! You do not need to be a coder or a seasoned open source contributor to submit a story. We want to see all kinds of stories represented here, from typo fixes to translation efforts, epic refactorings to event organizing. We plan to share this site at events for newcomers such as Open Source Comes to Campus , so stories from people who are just beginning in open source are especially welcome. The best stories are those which give a lot of detail and talk about the mistakes you made, not just the successes you had. Everyone, even people who've been contributing for decades, make mistakes sometimes. Why not share yours, so we can all learn from them? How is it licensed? All stories contributed to MergeStories are licensed CC BY-SA 4.0 . This means that anyone can use them for any purposes, as long as they attribute the original author and share their changes under the same terms. Who made MergeStories? MergeStories was conceived of by Shauna Gordon-McKeon and designed and developed with the help of Asheesh Laroia . It is a project of OpenHatch . Other contributors include: Paul Tagliamonte Amol Bhave How can I help? Anyone is welcome to contribute! (Fair warning: we will definitely ask you to write a merge story about your contribution.) The project repository can be found on Github . You can follow the instructions in the README to set up the project locally and look for issues to work on in the issue tracker .

(SciPy refers to both the scientific computing library I contributed to, as well as the general open source package which also includes projects like iPython and Matplotlib.) I felt a bit intimidated at first, because I'm not an expert in statistics or python, so I decided to start with one of the issues labeled easy_fix . I browsed through many of the issues before finding one that I thought I had a prayer of being able to handle. The issue I picked dealt with the following problem. Probabilities must be between 0 and 1. The limit of zero means \"no chance of happening\" while the limit of 1 means \"will always happen\". A probability of greater than 1 therefore makes no sense. However, due to unavoidable rounding errors , occasionally probabilities were being produced that were greater than 1. The person who reported the issue, a maintainer, suggested that the numpy function clip be used to deal with this problem. My first step was to figure out where to make this change. The person who reported the issue had asked to change the probabilities titled \"cdf, sf, pmf\". I did a search for each of these using Github's search-repository interface. There were many results, but only one file where the functions were defined ( this one ), so that seemed like a good place to start. Rather than go too far down the wrong path, I left a quick comment asking for confirmation and got a helpful reply. With the help of the numpy documentation for the suggested function, clip, I was able to implement this change fairly easily, but I wasn't done yet! The maintainer asked me to time the function before and after my changes. They didn't want to accept the change if it slowed things down too much. I'd never timed anything before, and at their suggestion explored the Timeit python library . I found this to be an interesting and useful tool to learn about. Harder was choosing some \"normal\" and \"slow\" test functions -- I am not familiar enough with statistics to have an intuition of which distributions are easy to calculate and which are hard to calculate. I searched through the documentation and issues for references to \"slow\" distributions until I was able to find one. I commented with the results from Timeit, only to discover that more challenges lay ahead! First, the maintainer asked me to implement a unit test. This is a very reasonable request, but I don't have a formal programming background and I'd never worked with unit tests before. I was able to muddle through with the help of the maintainer, but I wish I'd had resources like Ned Bachtelder's talk on unit testing at PyCon 2014 to consult! The maintainer also advised me to develop on a separate branch from master and to use the SciPy standard acronyms when making commit messages. Luckily I was already familiar with branching in git and amending commits and pull requests, and was able to make these changes fairly easily. (To refresh, though, I used this great branching tutorial .) Unfortunately, when I added my tests, things did not work perfectly - my changes induced no less than 8 failures. It turned out that one of the distributions affected by the change was incompatible with it, and I had to remove the clipping function from more than half of the places I'd added it. Another issue was with how I'd written the test, which was by building it into a pre-existing test. This didn't make much sense - with unit tests, I now know it's good practice to test each behavior separately - and at the maintainer's suggestion, I split it off into a new test. At this point, we were finally finished. I learned a ton from making this contribution, thanks in large part due to the extensive help from Evgeni Burovski, the maintainer I was working with. I highly recommend contributing to SciPy, and hope to do so again soon!

Individuals agree to write a blog post every week or pay $5; when enough money is collected, the group meets for pizza and beer. The Iron Blogger software, which is built off of the Planet feed aggregator , provides a feed of all the blog posts written by participants combined. I enjoyed reading this feed but was annoyed that it only showed the most recent 15 posts. I decided to change Iron Blogger to show more. I was new to FOSS at the time and didn't really know where to begin. Luckily I was friends with the maintainer of the project and he was able to point me to where the source code was stored (it has since moved). After several hours of poking around the repository, looking through Planet's documentation, and emailing both my friend and the Planet mailing list, I was able to identify the variable to change. I'm afraid I don't remember the details of the obstacles I faced, as this was several years ago now. I do remember telling my friend, \"Okay, I found the variable! You just need to go to line 37 in the configuration file and change itemsperpage from 15 to, say, 50...\" He told me to submit a patch. He explained what a patch was and gave me a link to a tutorial that looked something like this . I was then able to generate a patch, which he merged into the project. A few years later, the project was put on Github, so you can see the commit (linked below). This was a great first contribution to make, because it was something I cared about but also something very straightforward to fix with my programming background (which is not very extensive, but did cover variables and configuration files). I was also lucky to have someone willing to walk me through the basics of downloading repositories and creating patches.

Recently, some GIMP contributors contacted me about arranging an online event to help them improve their documentation. I wanted to see how their documentation currently looked, so I went to their website and started clicking and reading links. When I got to the link for their installation guide , it sent me to a blank page. I wanted to confirm that it wasn't just a problem with my browser, so I opened up the page in both Firefox and Chrome. Then I asked some friends (the kinds folks on the #openhatch IRC channel) what they saw at the link, and they also saw nothing. Before I could proceed with the next step, one of them dug up the correct link for me! I decided to file a bug so that someone else could make this presumably easy fix. To file the bug, I found the project's bug tracker, and within that, the tracker for the GIMP website. I checked the list of bugs to see if anyone had already reported this problem. They hadn't, so I wrote up a quick report.

I took it upon myself to: Email the original authors of the code Talk to prospective users on IRC Work on it a lot at the yearly Debian conference in 2011 -- I already planned on going, and instead of just socializing, I used the Debconf hack lab space to work on this. Transition it to a different community that now maintains it -- I did this by intentionally making contribution really easy, and then repeatedly asking for help on the debian-mentors email list. All in all, I had a fun time. It is always a pleasure to help Debian. I learned a lot about the Pylons web framework as a result, which I mostly learned through massive Googling.
