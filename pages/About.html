            <p><strong>What are merge stories?</strong></p>
<p>Merge stories are stories about contributions that people have made to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">free and open source projects</a>. They give details about the process: how people pick issues to work on, the common obstacles they run into, the resources they use to solve problems, and more. We hope that by sharing these stories, we can give newcomers a better sense of what contributing is like.</p>
<p>There are some other benefits to submitting a story. Writing out what you did to make a contribution can help you remember what you learned later. Spelling out the details of your process can help people making similar contributions when they get stuck. And by submitting stories, you can create a record of the work you've done beyond a list of commits.</p>
<p><strong>Who can contribute?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone! You do <em>not</em> need to be a coder or a seasoned open source contributor to submit a story. We want to see all kinds of stories represented here, from typo fixes to translation efforts, epic refactorings to event organizing. We plan to share this site at events for newcomers such as <a href="http://campus.openhatch.org/">Open Source Comes to Campus</a>, so stories from people who are just beginning in open source are especially welcome.</p>
<p>The best stories are those which give a lot of detail and talk about the mistakes you made, not just the successes you had. Everyone, even people who've been contributing for decades, make mistakes sometimes. Why not share yours, so we can all learn from them?</p>
<p><strong>How is it licensed?</strong></p>
<p>All stories contributed to MergeStories are licensed <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>. This means that anyone can use them for any purposes, as long as they attribute the original author and share their changes under the same terms.</p>
<p><strong>Who made MergeStories?</strong></p>
<p>MergeStories was conceived of by <a href="http://www.shaunagm.net/">Shauna Gordon-McKeon</a> and designed and developed with the help of <a href="http:​/​/​www​.​asheesh​.​org​/">Asheesh Laroia</a>.  It is a project of <a href="http://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch</a>.  Other contributors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul Tagliamonte</li>
<li>Amol Bhave</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How can I help?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone is welcome to contribute! (Fair warning: we will definitely ask you to write a merge story about your contribution.) The project repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/openhatch/oh-contribution-stories">on Github</a>. You can follow the instructions in the <a href="">README</a> to set up the project locally and look for issues to work on in the <a href="https://github.com/openhatch/oh-contribution-stories/issues">issue tracker</a>. Please leave a comment when you start working on an issue, and say hello in our <a href="http://openhatch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/community/contact.html">IRC channel</a>, #openhatch on Freenode.</p>
