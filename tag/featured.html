                <time pubdate="pubdate" datetime="2014-06-17T00:19:20">Tue 17 June 2014</time>
                <p> <p>I started hanging out on OpenHatch's IRC channel and mailing lists, generally learning about the project, getting to know its people, and finding out where I could help with its goals (helping people contribute to free and open source projects). I'm a community manager instead of a developer, so often the things I can help with aren't listed in a bug tracker. One of these ways of helping happened a few months later. I realized that OpenHatch-the-organization did a lot more than what the OpenHatch website homepage described -- and that the homepage was unintentionally outdated, instead of being purposefully designed to focus on only a few things. So at an in-person project sprint soon after that, I decided that my task for the day would be to work on this problem!</p></p>

                <p> <p>At the sprints, I met someone who was working on a new configuration management system for Drupal. If you're not familiar with Drupal, configuration management at that point was a HUGE PAIN. All the configuration was in the database (!!), so it was impossible to version. This sucked, a lot.  He was asking people to help convert Drupal systems to the new configuration management system. I thought this sounded SUPER AWESOME.  So here I'm at an awesome open source conference, with a community which is super welcoming to beginners, working on a component that I'm personally interested in improving (configuration management), and there are people who can help me contribute in real life.  WHAT COULD BE BETTER?</p></p>

                <time pubdate="pubdate" datetime="2014-06-10T18:05:00">Tue 10 June 2014</time>
                <p> <p>I found <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> when searching for projects that were both in the domain of scientific research and statistical analysis, and written in the python programming language.  (SciPy refers to both the scientific computing library I contributed to, as well as the general open source package which also includes projects like iPython and Matplotlib.)  I felt a bit intimidated at first, because I'm not an expert in statistics or python, so I decided to start with one of the <a href="https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues?labels=easy-fix&amp;page=1&amp;state=open">issues labeled easy_fix</a>.  I browsed through many of the issues before finding one that I thought I had a prayer of being able to handle...</p></p>

                <p> <p>I discovered, through reading the Debian wiki, that there was a new web app created for Debian called Debexpo, and it was nearly ready to replace our existing package review tool, but not quite ready.  I took it upon myself to...</p></p>
