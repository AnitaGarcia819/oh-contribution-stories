If you're not familiar with Drupal, configuration management at that point was a HUGE PAIN. All the configuration was in the database (!!), so it was impossible to version. This sucked, a lot.  He was asking people to help convert Drupal systems to the new configuration management system. I thought this sounded SUPER AWESOME.  So here I'm at an awesome open source conference, with a community which is super welcoming to beginners, working on a component that I'm personally interested in improving (configuration management), and there are people who can help me contribute in real life.

<p>I found <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> when searching for projects that were both in the domain of scientific research and statistical analysis, and written in the python programming language.  (SciPy refers to both the scientific computing library I contributed to, as well as the general open source package which also includes projects like iPython and Matplotlib.)  I felt a bit intimidated at first, because I'm not an expert in statistics or python, so I decided to start with one of the <a href="https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues?labels=easy-fix&amp;page=1&amp;state=open">issues labeled easy_fix</a>.  I browsed through many of the issues before finding one that I thought I had a prayer of being able to handle...</p>

<p>The Iron Blogger software, which is built off of the <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/">Planet feed aggregator</a>, provides a feed of all the blog posts written by participants combined.  I enjoyed reading this feed but was annoyed that it only showed the most recent 15 posts.  I decided to change Iron Blogger to show more...</p>

<p>I've been using GIMP for years, but I've never contributed to it. I wanted to see how their documentation currently looked, so I went to <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">their website</a> and started clicking and reading links.  When I got to the link for their <a href="https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/INSTALL">installation guide</a>, it sent me to a blank page...</p>
