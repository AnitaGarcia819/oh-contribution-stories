I discovered, through reading the Debian wiki, that there was a new web app created for Debian called Debexpo, and it was nearly ready to replace our existing package review tool, but not quite ready.

I took it upon myself to:

* Email the original authors of the code

* Talk to prospective users on IRC

* Work on it a lot at the yearly Debian conference in 2011 -- I already planned on going, and instead of just socializing, I used the Debconf hack lab space to work on this.

* Transition it to a different community that now maintains it -- I did this by intentionally making contribution really easy, and then repeatedly asking for help on the debian-mentors email list.

All in all, I had a fun time. It is always a pleasure to help Debian.

I learned a lot about the Pylons web framework as a result, which I mostly learned through massive Googling.
