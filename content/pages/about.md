Title: About MergeStories
Slug: About

__What are merge stories?__

Merge stories are stories about all kinds of contributions that people have made to [free and open source projects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software). They give details about the process: how people pick issues to work on, the common obstacles they run into, the resources they use to solve problems, and more. We hope that by sharing these stories, we can give newcomers a better sense of what contributing is like.

The name "merge stories" comes from the [version control term](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(revision_control)) meaning "to combine multiple versions of files".  Most open source contributions made through version control systems finish with a "merge".  Some open source contributions, like answering questions on mailing lists, promoting a project through social media, or designing a promotional flyer, might not be merged into version control, but they are still metaphorically merged into the project.  Stories about these kinds of contributions are absolutely welcome!

__Who can contribute?__

Anyone! You do _not_ need to be a coder or a seasoned open source contributor to submit a story. We want to see all kinds of stories represented here, from typo fixes to translation efforts, epic refactorings to organized events. We plan to share this site at workshops for newcomers such as [Open Source Comes to Campus](http://campus.openhatch.org/), so stories from people who are just beginning in open source are especially welcome.

The best stories are those which give a lot of detail, and don't brush over the obstacles you encountered or failures you experienced. Stories about unsuccessful contributions are also encouraged. Everyone, even people who've been contributing for decades, make mistakes sometimes. Why not share yours, so we can all learn from them?

__Why should I contribute?__

Writing out the details of how you made a contribution can help you remember the things that you learned and identify ways you can improve. Talking about your process will also help people making similar contributions. And by submitting stories, you can create a record of the work you've done beyond a list of commits.
