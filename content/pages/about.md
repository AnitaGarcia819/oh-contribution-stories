__What are merge stories?__

Merge stories are stories about contributions that people have made to [free and open source projects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software). They give details about the process: how people pick issues to work on, the common obstacles they run into, the resources they use to solve problems, and more. We hope that by sharing these stories, we can give newcomers a better sense of what contributing is like.

There are some other benefits to submitting a story. Writing out what you did to make a contribution can help you remember what you learned later. Spelling out the details of your process can help people making similar contributions when they get stuck. And by submitting stories, you can create a record of the work you've done beyond a list of commits.

__Who can contribute?__

Anyone! You do _not_ need to be a coder or a seasoned open source contributor to submit a story. We want to see all kinds of stories represented here, from typo fixes to translation efforts, epic refactorings to event organizing. We plan to share this site at events for newcomers such as [Open Source Comes to Campus](http://campus.openhatch.org/), so stories from people who are just beginning in open source are especially welcome.

The best stories are those which give a lot of detail and talk about the mistakes you made, not just the successes you had. Everyone, even people who've been contributing for decades, make mistakes sometimes. Why not share yours, so we can all learn from them?
