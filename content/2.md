I've been using GIMP for years, but I've never contributed to it.  Recently, some GIMP contributors contacted me about arranging an online event to help them improve their documentation.  I wanted to see how their documentation currently looked, so I went to [their website](http://www.gimp.org/) and started clicking and reading links.  When I got to the link for their [installation guide](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/INSTALL), it sent me to a blank page.  

I wanted to confirm that it wasn't just a problem with my browser, so I opened up the page in both Firefox and Chrome.  Then I asked some friends (the kinds folks on the #openhatch IRC channel) what they saw at the link, and they also saw nothing.  Before I could proceed with the next step, one of them dug up the [correct link](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/INSTALL.in) for me!  I decided to file a bug so that someone else could make this presumably easy fix.    

To file the bug, I found the project's bug tracker, and within that, the tracker for the GIMP website.  I checked the list of bugs to see if anyone had already reported this problem.  They hadn't, so I wrote up a quick report.
